                <h2><q>The Hard Way</q> Song Lyrics</h2>
                <p>I've been, I've been, I've been<br />
                I've been touching fires for the sake of feeling<br />
                I've been chasing, chasing<br />
                Chasing all these highs so I could crash the ceiling<br />
                I've been restless, tempted to follow every devil way down<br />
                I took it so low and at that time it looked like no way out</p>

                <p>I had to see, try to believe<br />
                I write my story and this ain't how it's ending<br />
                Said to myself, said to myself,<br />
                <q>This ain't how I'm gonna go down</q></p>

                <p>When the bottom hit my soul<br />
                I had to climb up all alone<br />
                When the night shot down my hope<br />
                I had to find a light to hold<br />
                You gotta pray just a little<br />
                Die just a little<br />
                To come alive in the right way<br />
                And sometimes to get home<br />
                You gotta go the hard way, hard way</p>

                <p>Turning, turning, turning<br />
                Turning every corner 'cause my heart was yearning<br />
                For something more than<br />
                4 a.m. messed up in bed, oh I don't miss that feeling<br />
                I don't see a reason chasing love down a dead-end<br />
                But, see, the truth is, I wouldn't know that unless I did</p>

                <p>I had to see, try to believe<br />
                I write my story and this ain't how it's ending<br />
                Said to myself, said to myself,<br />
                <q>This ain't how I'm gonna go down</q></p>

                <p>When the bottom hit my soul<br />
                I had to climb up all alone<br />
                When the night shot down my hope<br />
                I had to find a light to hold<br />
                You gotta pray just a little<br />
                Die just a little<br />
                To come alive in the right way<br />
                And sometimes to get home<br />
                You gotta go the hard way</p>

                <p>I wouldn't know what I'm made of<br />
                If I took the easy way out<br />
                As long as it took me to get here<br />
                The hard times were worth what I found<br />
                I wouldn't know what I'm made of<br />
                If I took the easy way out<br />
                As long as it took me to get here<br />
                The hard times were worth what I found</p>

                <p>When the bottom hit my soul<br />
                I had to climb up all alone<br />
                When the night shot down my hope<br />
                I had to find a light to hold<br />
                You gotta break just a little, die just a little<br />
                To come alive in the right way<br />
                And sometimes to get home<br />
                You gotta go the hard way</p>
